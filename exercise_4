Explaining the cipher problem

When running the code we get an error within encode and map on line 3 and the block in line 4 with the message
  "nil can't be coerced into Integer"
This implies that the problem is in trying to add nil (in line 4).
This leads to thinking that there is a char which it can't find the index of (i.e. we are missing a character in the cipher)
so the cipher is returning nil. Looking at the code of cipher we see that ('a'...'z').to_a outputs an array containing the letters
a to y, excluding z, due to using ... rather than ..
Changing this, the encode method is debugged.

Comparing lines 4 and 12 we expect these to be opposites in the sense that when we add something we should be taking it away
to get back to the starting char number. Instead, what we are doing is adding and then taking away our result from what we added initially.
i.e 1 + 5 then 1 - 6 which doesn't get back to where we started. So we conclude that the subtraction should be the other way around
i.e char.ord - 65
